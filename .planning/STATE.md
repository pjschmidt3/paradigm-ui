## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Separate type files as lib items**: Registered `box-types` and `helper-types` as `registry:lib` items for proper type installation
- **shadcn-button naming**: Registered src/components/ui/button.tsx as "shadcn-button" to differentiate from premium button

### Deferred Issues

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

Build produces warnings about "use client" directives and React UMD globals (cosmetic, does not block functionality).
