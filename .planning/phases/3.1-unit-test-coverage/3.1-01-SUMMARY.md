# Phase 3.1 Plan 01: Typography Tests Summary

**Unit tests for Heading and Paragraph components with 32 passing tests covering levels, classes, accessibility, and prop spreading**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-13T14:44:25Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-13T14:48:08Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive Heading tests covering all 5 levels (h1-h5) with correct element rendering and class assertions
- Created Paragraph tests covering basic rendering, default classes, className merging, and HTML attribute spreading
- 32 total tests passing: 14 for Heading, 18 for Paragraph
- Tests use Testing Library best practices (role queries, accessible assertions)

## Files Created/Modified
- `registry/new-york/ui/__tests__/heading.test.tsx` - 14 tests covering levels, classes, accessibility
- `registry/new-york/ui/__tests__/paragraph.test.tsx` - 18 tests covering rendering, classes, props, edge cases
- `jest.config.ts` - Created Jest configuration for TypeScript/React testing
- `package.json` - Added jest, ts-jest, jest-environment-jsdom dependencies

## Decisions Made
- Used Jest + ts-jest for test infrastructure (aligned with existing @testing-library setup)
- Test file location follows existing pattern in `__tests__/` directory
- Used `screen.getByRole('heading', { level: X })` for accessibility-focused queries

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Installed missing Jest dependencies**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Heading tests creation)
- **Issue:** Jest was not fully installed - only @types/jest was present, not jest itself
- **Fix:** Installed jest, ts-jest, jest-environment-jsdom, @testing-library/user-event
- **Files modified:** package.json, package-lock.json
- **Verification:** `npm test` runs successfully

**2. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Created Jest configuration**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Heading tests creation)
- **Issue:** No jest.config.ts existed for TypeScript/React test transformation
- **Fix:** Created jest.config.ts with ts-jest, jsdom environment, and path aliases
- **Files modified:** jest.config.ts
- **Verification:** Tests compile and run via ts-jest

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (2 blocking), 0 deferred
**Impact on plan:** Both auto-fixes required to enable test execution. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
None - plan executed successfully after test infrastructure was established.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Test infrastructure now fully configured with Jest + ts-jest
- Ready for 3.1-02-PLAN.md (Layout component tests: Box, Flex, Grid)
- Pattern established for future component tests
